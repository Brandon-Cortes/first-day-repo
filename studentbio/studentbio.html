    <p>My name is Brandon Cortes, I am a 27 year old mexican who is trying to learn to code. I honestly never thought that this was going to be something 
        i would have tried but here we are. I want to be able to start a small project like a little game or get a better job than customer support at an IT place. Luckily I have friends who believe
        that I am capable. 
     </p>
     <p> The next time I make another Bio page i hope to have learned something i can implement on a page and have the page look modern.
         to be honest im really nervous and feel like i could fail, but i keep telling myself that failure is not an option.
